What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
Artificial Intelligence is a field of computer science that develops systems capable of performing tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, perception, and decision-making.

What is the difference between weak AI and strong AI?
Weak AI (or narrow AI) is designed for specific tasks, such as virtual assistants and recommendation systems. Strong AI, on the other hand, would have self-awareness and the ability to understand and reason about any subject like a human being.

What is Machine Learning and how is it related to AI?
Machine Learning is a subfield of AI that teaches machines to learn patterns from data without explicit programming. It allows systems to improve their performance over time with experience.

What are the main types of machine learning?
The three main types are:
- **Supervised Learning**: The model learns from labeled data.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: The model identifies patterns without labels.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: The model learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties.

What are artificial neural networks?
They are models inspired by the functioning of the human brain, composed of layers of artificial neurons that process information and adjust their weights to recognize patterns and make decisions.

What are the risks of Artificial Intelligence?
Some risks include algorithmic bias, job loss due to automation, misuse in surveillance or warfare, and the possibility of superintelligence beyond human control.

How is AI used in everyday life?
AI is present in virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa), recommendation systems (Netflix, Spotify), facial recognition, autonomous cars, medical diagnostics, chatbots, and much more.

What is natural language processing (NLP)?
It is a field of AI that enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language, used in machine translation, chatbots, and voice assistants.

Can AI replace humans in the workforce?
AI can automate repetitive and analytical tasks, but it is unlikely to fully replace humans in creative, emotional, and critical thinking jobs.

What is a generative AI model?
It is a type of AI that can create new content, such as images, text, and music, based on patterns learned from large amounts of data. Examples include ChatGPT and DALLÂ·E.
